# Lush Moments Backend Development Plan

This plan outlines the step-by-step development of the FastAPI backend for Lush Moments, based on the requirements in `instruction.md`. The project involves building a robust API with authentication, database integration, real-time features, and deployment readiness.

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Infrastructure

### 1.1 Initialize Project Structure
- Create a virtual environment for Python dependencies
- Set up `pyproject.toml` with FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and other core dependencies
- Create basic directory structure:
  - `app/` for main application code
  - `app/models/` for database models
  - `app/schemas/` for Pydantic schemas
  - `app/routes/` for API endpoints
  - `app/utils/` for utilities (auth, caching, etc.)
  - `tests/` for unit and integration tests
  - `migrations/` for database migrations
- Initialize Git repository

### 1.2 Configure Environment and Dependencies
- Install required packages: FastAPI, Uvicorn, SQLAlchemy, Alembic, Pydantic, JWT libraries, Redis client, WebSocket support
- Set up environment variables for database, Redis, JWT secrets, etc.
- Create `.env` file template and `.gitignore`

### 1.3 Database Setup
- Set up PostgreSQL database (local or Docker)
- Configure SQLAlchemy engine and session
- Initialize Alembic for migrations

## Phase 2: Core Models and Database Schema

### 2.1 Define Database Models
- Create SQLAlchemy models for all core entities:
  - User (id, name, email, phone, role)
  - EventBooking (id, client_info, event_type, date, venue, package_id, message, status)
  - Package (id, name, description, price, included_items)
  - Theme (id, name, description, gallery_images)
  - Testimonial (id, name, message, image_url, rating)
  - Session (session_id, linked_user, created_at, chat_history)
  - ChatMessage (id, session_id, sender_type, message, timestamp)
  - Translation (content_type, object_id, language_code, field_name, translated_text)
- Define relationships between models
- Add indexes and constraints as needed

### 2.2 Create Database Migrations
- Generate initial migration with Alembic
- Run migrations to create tables
- Seed database with initial data (admin user, sample packages/themes)

## Phase 3: Authentication and Authorization

### 3.1 Implement JWT Authentication
- Create authentication utilities (password hashing, JWT token generation/validation)
- Implement user registration and login endpoints
- Add middleware for JWT token verification

### 3.2 Role-Based Access Control
- Implement role checking (admin vs client)
- Protect admin endpoints with role validation
- Handle anonymous sessions for non-authenticated users

## Phase 4: API Endpoints Implementation

### 4.1 Public Endpoints
- `GET /packages`: List all packages with translations
- `GET /themes`: List all themes with gallery images
- `GET /testimonials`: List testimonials
- `POST /bookings`: Create new event booking
- `POST /sessions`: Create anonymous chat session
- `POST /chat/connect`: Establish WebSocket/SSE connection for chat

### 4.2 Admin Endpoints
- CRUD for packages: `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /admin/packages`
- CRUD for themes: `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /admin/themes`
- CRUD for testimonials: `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /admin/testimonials`
- `GET /admin/bookings`: List all bookings
- `PATCH /admin/bookings/{id}`: Update booking status
- `GET /admin/sessions`: List active chat sessions
- `PATCH /admin/sessions/{id}`: Link anonymous session to user
- `POST /admin/chat/respond`: Send admin/bot messages

### 4.3 Implement Pydantic Schemas
- Create request/response schemas for all endpoints
- Handle validation and serialization

## Phase 5: Advanced Features

### 5.1 Multi-Language Support
- Implement translation retrieval logic
- Add endpoints for managing translations (admin)
- Integrate translations into package/theme responses

### 5.2 Real-Time Chat with WebSocket
- Set up WebSocket endpoint for chat connections
- Handle message sending/receiving
- Store chat history in database
- Implement session management

### 5.3 Caching with Redis
- Configure Redis connection
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data (packages, themes)
- Cache user sessions and chat history

### 5.4 Background Tasks
- Set up background task system (FastAPI BackgroundTasks or Celery)
- Implement email notifications for bookings
- Add task for processing chat responses (if using AI)

### 5.5 Media Handling
- Integrate Cloudinary or local file storage
- Add endpoints for uploading gallery images
- Handle image URLs in themes and testimonials

## Phase 6: Testing and Validation

### 6.1 Unit Tests
- Write tests for models, utilities, and individual functions
- Test authentication logic
- Test database operations

### 6.2 Integration Tests
- Test API endpoints with FastAPI TestClient
- Test WebSocket connections
- Test database interactions

### 6.3 End-to-End Testing
- Test complete user flows (registration, booking, chat)
- Validate admin functionalities

## Phase 7: Deployment and Production

### 7.1 Docker Setup
- Create Dockerfile for the application
- Set up docker-compose.yml with PostgreSQL, Redis, and app services
- Configure environment variables for production

### 7.2 Production Configuration
- Set up production database and Redis
- Configure logging and monitoring
- Implement health checks

### 7.3 Deployment
- Deploy to cloud platform (Heroku, AWS, etc.)
- Set up CI/CD pipeline
- Configure domain and SSL

## Phase 8: Documentation and Finalization

### 8.1 API Documentation
- Use FastAPI's automatic OpenAPI documentation
- Add custom documentation for complex endpoints
- Document WebSocket usage

### 8.2 Code Documentation
- Add docstrings to all functions and classes
- Create README with setup and usage instructions

### 8.3 Final Testing and Optimization
- Performance testing
- Security audit
- Code review and refactoring

## Timeline and Milestones

- **Week 1-2**: Phase 1 (Setup) + Phase 2 (Models)
- **Week 3-4**: Phase 3 (Auth) + Phase 4 (Basic APIs)
- **Week 5-6**: Phase 5 (Advanced Features)
- **Week 7**: Phase 6 (Testing)
- **Week 8**: Phase 7-8 (Deployment and Docs)

## Risk Mitigation

- Regular code reviews and testing to catch issues early
- Use version control for all changes
- Document assumptions and decisions
- Plan for scalability from the start

This plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for building the Lush Moments backend. Each phase builds upon the previous one, ensuring a solid foundation before adding complex features.
